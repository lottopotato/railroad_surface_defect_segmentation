Railroad Surface Defect Segmentation Using a Modified Fully Convolutional Network

This code is **old version** for paper, 
- H. Kim, S. Lee and S. Han, "Railroad Surface Defect Segmentation Using a Modified Fully Convolutional Network," KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, vol. 14, no. 12, pp. 4763-4775, 2020. DOI: 10.3837/tiis.2020.12.008.
